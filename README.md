# Sllick

Sllick is a project that I started to improve my iOS Development knowledge. Later on, I have decided to make it public, open source, and as it's still under development, it's available for testing on TestFlight.

It uses Firebase's Authentication/Database/Storage libraries for messaging implementation, Firebase's realtime database and cloud functions for presence detection, SinchRTC for calling, OneSignal for notifications, and several other libraries.
